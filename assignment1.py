# list=[1,12,30,40,15,16,80,19]
# You have the above list of numbers 
# print the list out
# print the sum out
# If the sum is greater than 100, print out it is greater than 100 and else print out it is less than 100

print("This is the reult of the sum of", i)
if i > 100:
    print("it is the greater than 100")
else:
    print("no it is less than 100")
