# Mrs Kosovo monthly budget is #200,000 from her husband.
# She bought foodstuff for 45000
# She paid her monthly rent son her shop 10000
# She paid for children lessons 25000
# She paid her house help 10000
# Write python  code that will calculate how much 
# she has left from her budget and print it out
# Solution
monthly = 200000
cost = 45000 + 10000 + 25000 + 10000
balance = monthly - cost
print(balance)

# The length of a rectangle is 20m and the width is 18m
# write a python code to calculate the area
# calculate the  perimeter of the area  
# subtract the perimeter from the area
# solution
area = 20 * 18
perimeter = (20+18)*2
answer = perimeter - area
print(answer)


# The diameter of a circle  is 10m
# if pi is equal  to 3.142
# using a python code calculate the area of a circle
# solution
radius = 10/2
area = 3.142 * radius * radius
print(area)


# The radius of circle is 45cm, if pie =3.142.
# Write a python code that will calculate the area of the circle
# and the circumference of the circle. 
# Add the area and the circumference together and 
# print it out
# solution
radius = 45
circumference = 2 * 3.142 * radius
area = 3.142 * radius * radius
total = circumference + area
print(total)
